## 🧭 Overview

This repository hosts an ongoing investigation into the hypothesis that certain fundamental mathematical constants (like π, e, √2, φ) are not merely "random" sequences, but possess a rich, multi-scale **internal structure**. We term such numbers **"Structural Irrational Numbers"**.

The work began with a systematic analysis of **100 million digits** of π, which led to the identification and validation of six key mathematical properties:
1.  **Processuality** (Long-term memory)
2.  **Randomness** (Statistical appearance)
3.  **Inclusiveness** (Pattern completeness)
4.  **Alternation** (Transition balance)
5.  **Hierarchy** (Multi-scale relationship)
6.  **Nesting** (Periodic self-similarity)

## 📄 Core Document: The White Paper

The main theoretical synthesis and findings are documented in the **White Paper**:
- **[`WHITE_PAPER.md`](WHITE_PAPER.md)** - The living document outlining the theory, evidence, and conjectures.

## 🔬 Empirical Foundation

All computational evidence, analysis scripts, and the 100-million-digit dataset for π are archived and publicly available via **Science Data Bank**:
- **Dataset & Code DOI:** [10.57760/sciencedb.34550](https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.34550)

## 🚀 Current Research Directions

1.  **Formalizing the Theory**: Developing rigorous mathematical definitions for the six properties and the "Structural Irrational Number" class.
2.  **The Proportional Random Evolution Conjecture**: A new hypothesis proposing that structural scales evolve in proportion to their position in the sequence, governed by a slowly varying random process.
3.  **Cross-Constant Validation**: Extending the same analytical framework to other constants (e, √2, φ).
